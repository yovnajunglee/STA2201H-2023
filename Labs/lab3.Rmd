## Question 1

Consider the happiness example from the lecture, with 118 out of 129 women indicating they are happy. We are interested in estimating $\theta$, which is the (true) proportion of women who are happy. Calculate the MLE estimate $\hat{\theta}$ and 95% confidence interval. 

```{r}
thetahat <- 118/129
se.thet <- sqrt(thetahat*(1-thetahat)/129)
ci.thet <- c(thetahat - 1.96*se.thet,thetahat +1.96*se.thet)
```


$\hat \theta = 118/129 =$ `r round(118/129,3)` with 95% confidence interval (`round(ci.thet, 3)``)


## Question 2

Assume a Beta(1,1) prior on $\theta$. Calculate the posterior mean for $\hat{\theta}$ and 95% credible interval. 


Since the posterior distribution of  $\theta|y \sim Beta(y+1, n-y+1)$, the posterior mean is given by $\frac{y+1}{y+1+n-y+1} = \frac{118+1}{129+2}=$ `r round(119/131, 3)`.
## Question 3

Now assume a Beta(10,10) prior on $\theta$. What is the interpretation of this prior? Are we assuming we know more, less or the same amount of information as the prior used in Question 2?


## Question 4

Create a graph in ggplot which illustrates

- The likelihood (easiest option is probably to use `geom_histogram` to plot the histogram of appropriate random variables)
- The priors and posteriors in question 2 and 3 (use `stat_function` to plot these distributions)

Comment on what you observe. 


```{r}
# Likelihood of binomial distribution
bin.ll <- function(theta){
  dbinom(118, size = 129, prob = theta)
}

 
ggplot() + xlim(0, 1) + geom_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(1,1), col = 1, lty =2) +
  geom_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(119,129-118+1), col = 4) + 
  geom_function(fun = bin.ll, col = 2)


```

## Question 5

(No R code required) A study is performed to estimate the effect of a simple training program on basketball free-throw shooting. A random sample of 100 college students is recruited into the study. Each student first shoots 100 free-throws to establish a baseline success probability. Each student then takes 50 practice shots each day for a month. At the end of that time, each student takes 100 shots for a final measurement. Let $\theta$ be the average improvement in success probability. $\theta$ is measured as the final proportion of shots made minus the initial proportion of shots made. 

Given two prior distributions for $\theta$ (explaining each in a sentence):

- A noninformative prior, and

- A subjective/informative prior based on your best knowledge
